	  Prompt for experimental functionality. Attention: This is not likely
	  to work without problems
	help
	  Prompt for developer options. These options are only interesting for
	  libpayload developers.

	  This option allows you to select the compiler.
	help
	  Use the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

	  This is the heap size (malloc'able size) available
	  to the payload.
	  If unsure, set to 131072 (128K)
	help
	  This is the stack size available to the payload.
	  If unsure, set to 16384 (16K)
	help
	  This is the base address for the payload.
	  If unsure, set to 0x00100000 on x86, 0x00000000 on MIPS,
	  0x04000000 on ARM or 0x80100000 on ARM64.

	  TinyCurses was the first curses implementation for libpayload.
	  It features low memory consumption, static allocation of larger
	  data structures (so few or no memory allocation calls) and a
	  reduced feature set.
	help
	  libpayload's PDCurses port provides a full features curses
	  implementation, including libpanel, libmenu and libform (which
	  are taken from ncurses).
	  It requires more system resources, in particularily heap memory.

	  CBFS is the archive format of coreboot
	help
	  LZMA decoder implementation, usable eg. by CBFS,
	  but also externally.
	help
	  Decoder implementation for the LZ4 compression algorithm.
	  Adds standalone functions (CBFS support coming soon).
	help
	  Normally, libpayload will initialize console input/output on startup
	  before the payload itself gets control. This option disables that
	  behavior and leaves console initialization up to the payload.
	help
	  The alternate character set (ACS) is used for drawing lines and
	  displaying a couple of other special graphics characters.  The
	  ACS characters generally look good on screen, but can be difficult
	  to cut and paste from a terminal window to a text editor.
	  Say 'y' here if you want to always use plain ASCII characters to
	  approximate the appearance of ACS characters on the serial port
	  console.
	help
	  Say Y here if coreboot switched to a graphics mode and
	  your payload wants to use it.
	help
	  For recent chipsets with 256 NVRAM bytes, you have to access the
	  upper 128 bytes (128-255) using two different I/O ports,
	  usually 0x72/0x73.
	  On some chipsets this can be a different set of ports, though.
	  The VIA VT8237R for example only recognizes the ports 0x74/0x75
	  for accessing the high 128 NVRAM bytes (as seems to be the case for
	  multiple VIA chipsets).
	  If you want to read or write CMOS bytes on computers with one of
	  these chipsets, say 'y' here.
	help
	  Select this option if you want support for storage devices (like
	  hard drives, memory sticks or optical drives).
	help
	  If this is selected, sectors will be addressed by an 64-bit integer.
	  Select this to support LBA-48 for ATA drives.
	help
	  Select this option if you want support for ATA storage devices
	  (i.e. hard drives).
	help
	  Select this option if you want support for ATAPI storage devices
	  (i.e. optical drives like CD or DVD drives).
	help
	  Select this option if you want support for SATA controllers in
	  AHCI mode.
	help
	  If this option is selected only AHCI controllers which are known
	  to work will be used.

	  The timer driver is provided by the payload itself.
	help
	  This is the timer driver for marvell armada38x
	  platforms.
	help
	  IPQ hardware presently provides a single timer running at 32KHz, a
	  finer granulariry timer is available but is not yet enabled.

	help
	  Select this option if USB EHCI root hub supports TT (Transaction

	  Select this option if you want to debug the memory allocator. This
	  option logs all uses of the following functions:
	    void free(void *ptr);
	    void *malloc(size_t size);
	    void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);

	  Say N here unless you are debugging memory allocator problems.
	help
	  This option is turned on if the target system has a separate
	  IO address space. This is typically only the case on x86.
	help
	  Some early Cortex-A53 revisions had a hardware bug that results in
	  incorrect address calculations in rare cases. This option enables a
	  linker workaround to avoid those cases if your toolchain supports it.
